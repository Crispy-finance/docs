There are several types of proposals of which more can be added over time \(via a proposal, of course\). The proposal types listed here may either be naming conventions are special proposal types explicitly present in the governance mechanism.

These proposals are created automatically when Emergency actions are taken. If such a proposal is passed the emergency bond is slashed crediting it to the crispy treasury and  the emergency action is reversed.

### Guardian proposal

Any proposal that confirms, slashes or adjusts parameters of an existing guardian are called guardian proposals. You can learn more about guardians here.

### Meta proposal

Any proposal that makes changes to the governance mechanism are meta proposals.

### Symbolic proposals

Such proposals have no direct impact but symbolize a general statement endorsed by the community.
