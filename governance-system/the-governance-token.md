# The governance token

The Crispy.finance governance token also referred to by the ticker CRSPY is an ERC20-compatible token that gives holders the right to vote on core proposals within the crispy.finance ecosystem.

## Tokenomics

The CRSPY token is a capped supply token, meaning that no tokens can be created beyond the maximum cap of the initial 400 million tokens. Furthermore the token is **not a proxy contract** meaning that these facts cannot arbitrarily be changed like in many other projects.

#### Initial distribution

**Less than 10%** of the initial supply will be given to early founders and pre-ICO investors to compensate them for their early contributions. These tokens will be vested for long periods of time, with the community being able to cancel the vesting contracts and reclaim the locked tokens should the vested members act maliciously. This will ensure that the vested parties will act according to the interests of the overall project.

Furthermore all vesting will be subject to a cliff. This means that the vested parties will not receive a single CRSPY tokens until several months after the initial launch. Combined with the ability to void the vesting contract this protects the ICO investors from potential exit-scammers who would otherwise have no incentive to act otherwise. This is similar to traditional startup vesting where the founders have to fulfill certain objectives and participate in the company for a minimum amount of time before being eligible to receive their shares.

**20% - 40%** of the initial supply will be sold in the round-A ICO to raise initial funds necessary for further development of Crispy.finance products and services. Similar to a traditional where all the money isn't raised at once but is instead split into several rounds to ensure continued motivation.

**The remainder** of the CRSPY tokens will be sent to the community governed treasury along with the funds raised in the initial ICO. What is done with the funds is entirely up to the community. Remaining tokens could be: sold of in further rounds to raise additional funds, used as collateral or simply taken out of circulation by burning. 

#### Overall value and purpose

Holders of the CRSPY token will be entitled to vote on proposals and create them. Furthermore holders will be eligible to a share of the profits once their decisions have lead to positive results. As a remainder the CRSPY token is not meant to be a passive investment but instead a fungible ballot used to participate in the Organizations decision-making process.
