# Introduction

Crispy is a smart contract development project aimed at providing tools for the hex ecosystem. We're currently working on _Crispy Staker_, a high-end stake wrapping protocol but plan to expand to building more tools in the future.

We hope you find value in our projects. Feel free to reach out to us on our telegram, constructive feedback is always welcome!
