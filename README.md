# Welcome to the Crispy.finance docs!

Crispy.finance is an ecosystem of dApps looking to bring the world to a fairer financial future, one dApp at a time.

Regulated via a governance system, Crispy.finance is powered by a decentralized collective of developers, organizers, marketers and voters.

## Core principals

### 1. Decentralization

Decentralization is often a buzz-word, but it has a purpose. By being decentralized Crispy.finance will be able to provide higher up-time and security than any centralized competitor. Decentralization is vital in avoiding central points of failure and censorship.

### 2. Accessibility

Where possible the products and services provided by Crispy.finance will be created in such a way that anyone can effectively use them regardless of their race, gender, geographical location, nationality or socioeconomic status.

### 3. Sustainability

Many cryptocurrency projects today rely solely on hype, memes and "price go up". Meanwhile they neglect to innovate and to create long lasting value for their ecosystems. Crispy.finance will not be the same, while marketing and even monetary gain is important, it is our mission to create an organization and ecosystem built on actual innovation and value creation.
