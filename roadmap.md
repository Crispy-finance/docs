# Roadmap

## Crispy Staker

2022 Q1 (currently being worked on): Launch of crispy staker beta: ability to create and end stakes

**Note:** While some of these features are already in progress and have a lot of work gone into them this is should not be considered a guarantee of their completion.

2022 Q2 and beyond:

* Ability to rollover stakes
* Ability to natively transfer stakes
* Stake alchemy (stake merging, splitting, reassembly)
* Expose more batching abilities in the UI (+ advanced tx editor)

## Other Projects / expansions

**Note:** These are mostly just broad ideas and plans of what may be created in the future. Very likely to be amended and for some ideas to be dropped.

* **Crispy Market:** for less royalty fees when buying / selling stakes as well as better options for exploring and discovering stakes
* **Crispy Pool Staker:** Pool staking system to share individual large stakes to reduce gas costs + fungible stake shares
* **Crispy Loans:** P2P loan market for creating stake collateralized loans, allow stakers to access some liquidity without selling. Allow smaller stakers to acquire larger stakes on credit
