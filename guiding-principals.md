# Guiding principals

Looking at the history of crypto there have been many scammers, fraudsters and questionable business practices. We want to be better and do better. We lay out the principals under which we operate here because we want people to know exactly what they can or cannot expect from us and so that we can be called out if we ever betray our principals.

### Transparency

The line between marketing and deception is often quite thin so we will not tread it. We will never promise things we cannot deliver or unsure we can deliver. When speculating about the future like in our [Roadmap](roadmap.md) we will always state what it is mere speculation and what is not.

### Security

We will always aim to ensure that our users's assets are secure. We will apply the best security practices where possible. If we skip an important security measure we will always inform and educate our users about the associated risks. This may for example be the case when launching apps in beta.

### Decentralization

We aim to maximize decentralization in our applications and make sure that our apps are trustless meaning that we have minimal control. Even if we become inactive, disappear or the regulatory environment changes your assets should always remain your own and under your full control.

### Fair compensation

While we may provide some of our services / apps for free we will charge for others. However we will always do so in a transparent, convenient and most importantly fair way. We will never tack on unnecessary tokens or require you to commit to long-term contracts with us. No charging for future benefits or expectations of some future gain. You'll only pay now for value gained now.
